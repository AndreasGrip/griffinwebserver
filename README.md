This is just a basic webserver that will serve any fill inside your projects www folder.

Reason for creating this was that I ended up needing a server like this for most of my project and got tired of rewrite/copy it all the time.

usage:
Once you added the webserver.js to your project. Create a www folder and it's content will be served.
